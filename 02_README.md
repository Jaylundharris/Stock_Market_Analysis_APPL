📊 Project Summary: Stock Market Analysis (AAPL)

This project analyzes Apple Inc.(AAPL) stock performance using historical daily data pulled directly from Yahoo Finance with Python’s yfinance library. The analysis focuses on identifying short- and medium-term price trends through 20-day and 50-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA). By plotting closing prices alongside these indicators, it becomes easier to visualize periods of momentum and potential reversals.

The study shows how price generally stays above the 50-day SMA during strong bullish phases and dips below it during corrections. This simple approach demonstrates how moving averages can help gauge market sentiment without complex models. The notebook also includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), return calculations, and visual insights presented using matplotlib.

Key Skills Demonstrated: Data acquisition (API), data cleaning, time-series analysis, feature engineering (SMA), data visualization, and analytical storytelling.
